Chop your breakfast on a mirror
Hell is worth all that, natural habitat
Just a rhyme without a reason
Life of death becoming clearer
Leading on your death's construction
I'm your source of self-destruction
Veins that pump with fear, sucking darkest clear
Pain monopoly, ritual misery
End of passion play, crumbling away
Never-ending maze, drift on numbered days
Now your life is out of season
Needlework the way, never you betray
